<!-- to redirect you have to have an object with an id, which doens't yet happen with the.new , but only assigned to the object once it's saved. so we changed to create,
bc .new doesn't save the object.
.build creates and associates to the object that's being built by the .new route -->


<!-- is the field_form iterating and creating another pair of name/quantity fields?  -->
<!-- why does it need the .build in the new action in the controller to display to the 
screen? isn't it optional to fill in default values for fields like that? -->
